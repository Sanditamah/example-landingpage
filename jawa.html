			<p align="justify">The Ujung Kulon peninsula is the western most extension of Java. The park includes the peninsula, as well as the offshore islands of Peucang and Panaitan. This beautiful peninsula, protected on three sides by the sea and on the east by the Honje Mountains,

The Rhino are rarely seen, but from the recent video trap in Ujung Kulon national Park between April and July 2015, three Javan rhinoceros calves recorded. The total number of surviving animals worldwide is now 60 and all reside in Ujung Kulon.</p><br />
